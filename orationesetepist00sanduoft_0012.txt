Preface

The Public Orator of Oxford, who has the important duty of com-
memorating the benefactors of that University every second year, in alternation
with the Professor of Poetry, has the privilege of presenting the recipients of
the honorary degree of Master of Arts alone, while the higher degrees honore}
causa (such as the distinguished degree of D.C.L.) belong to the province of
the Professors or other representatives of the several Faculties. The Public
Orator of Cambridge has the duty of presenting for all degrees, whether com-
plete or titular, which are conferred honoris causa in any Faculty whatsoever.

The distinction between complete and titular degrees honoris causa is im-
portant. It may here be explained that complete degrees honoris causa are
conferred at Cambridge solely on members of that University. Usually, the
recipients are Bishops or Deans, or Heads os Houses; these receive the complete
degree of D.D. Complete degrees may also be conferred on Members of the
Royal Family, Privy Councillors‚ Peers, or (by the amended Statute of 1893)
on Members of the Supreme Court of Judicature; these receive the complete
degree of LL.D.¹ In all the above cases the recipient of the complete degree
honoris causa pays a fee of 2650 to the University Chest.

The University has also power ‘to grant admission to complete Degrees
honoris causa, without fulfilment of the usual conditions, to persons who, having
already been admitted to a Degree in the University, or obtained some Uni-
versity office, are distinguished by conspicuous merit'2.

Under the first of the two alternatives in the above paragraph, the complete
degree of Doctor may (for example) be conferred honoris causa on a Cambridge
Professor ‘os conspicuous merit ’‚ who is already a Master of Arts of that
University. Thus the complete degree of LL.D. honoris causa was conferred
on Professor Maitland in 1891. In such cases the recipient pays to the
University Chest the sum of 2625, the ordinary fee for the complete degree
of Doctor.

Under the second of the above alternatives, the complete degree of M.A.
honoris causa is conferred on members of other Universities elected to a University
office in Cambridge. All of these, on becoming full Members of the Senate‚
pay the ordinary University see for the degree of M.A. (³612); and, until May,
1884, they paid a further fee os five guineas to the University Chest, and were
presented in a set speech by the Public Orator. Under the existing rule Pro-
fessors alone pay the extra see, and are presented in full form by the Orator.
The rest of the resident recipients of the complete degree of M.A. honoris causa
pay no such see, and are presented by him in the brief formula provided
for this purpose in the Ordinances.
