Preface

In contrast to the complete degrees honoris causa, which involve the pay-
ment of sees, are the titular degrees honoris causa, which are purely honorary,
and for which, of course, no sees are charged. These are rarely conserred on
resident members os the University‚ but they are occasionally bestowed on
Professors after a long period of distinguished service. The terms in which
titulat degrees are allowed in the Statutes are as follows: ‘ Titles os Degrees in
Arts, Law, Medicine, Surgery, Science, LetterS‚ or Music may be granted to
foreigners of distinction, or to British subjects who are of conspicuous merit or
have done good service to the State or to the University’1. It will be observed
that, by Statute, there is no titular degree in Divinity; while, in practice, there
is none in Medicine or Surgery. The titulat degrees actually conferred are
those of Doctor of Law‚ Doctor of Letters or Science, and Doctor of Music ;
also those of Master of Arts, and Master of Music.

During the last thirty-three years the Public Orator has delivered speeches
in presenting about 90 members of the University for the complete degree of
D.D.jure dignitatis, as Bishops‚ Deans, or Heads of Houses3 six sor the complete
degree os LL.D.²; one for that of Litt.D.⁸; and about 20 Professors for the
complete degree of Μ.Α. honoris causa. The recipients of titular degrees, whom
he has presented, are nearly 200 for the degree of LL.D.; more than 120 for
that of Doctor of Science; and more than 50 for that of Doctor of Letters,
Of 14 Doctors of Music, two only have been presented for the complete degree,
namely Joseph joachim (in 1877) and Professor Stanford (in 1887). In the
exceptional case of joachim, the Orator acted (by special request) on behalf
of the Professor of Music⁴. Titular Degrees in Music (as well as in Science and
Letters) have only been allowed by Statute since February 1882. Of 30 persons
presented in full form for the degree of Μ.Α. honoris causa (besides the
20 Professors above mentioned), some have received the complete, and others
the titulat, degree. In the Index, all complete degrees honoris causa are printed
in Roman type, and all titulat degrees in Italics.

revised. Small matters of spelling have been made more uniform. There has
