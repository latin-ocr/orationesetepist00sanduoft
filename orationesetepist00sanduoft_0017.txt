Preface

of an author's work. It will, however, be frequently found at the foot of the page,
or, in some of the earlier cases, in the Index. The N otes, in general, supply the
basis of fact on which the composition is founded.

The names of all the recipients of addresses or degrees have been entered in
the Index, which also includes a selection of carefully ascertained biographical
dates. Bishops are entered under the names of their sees, as well as under their
sui-names ; and all recipients of degrees, besides being registered in the alpha-
betical order os their names, are grouped under the Universities to which they
belong. It thus appears that the number of titular degrees conferred by
Cambridge on her own sonS, during the period covered in this volume, is
nearly forty‚ and that the number conferred on members of the University
of Oxford is exactly sixty.

During the unexpectedly protracted preparation of this volume, it has been
a pleasure to light upon the letters Ι have received in past years from many of
those whom 1 have had the privilege of presenting for theIr degrees, A single
specimen may here suffice :—

‘Cobham‚ Surrey, June 23rd, 1883.
My dear Sir,

A thousand thanks for the printed copies of your speeches, which you have so kindly sent
to me. 1 am glad the speeches are in this permanent form. For myself, 1 can only say, that 1

could wish the next age <if the next age enquires at all about me) to read no other and no longer ’
character of me than yours.

Most truly yours,
Matthew Arnold.'

1 venture to hope that, among those who give a kindly welcome to this
volume, there will be found not a few of the many friends of the distinguished
persons (whether living or dead) whose merits are recalled in its pages ; and that
it will also prove a pleasant memento os the past to those of the Honorary
Graduates and Benesactors os this University who are, happily, still living.

J. E. SANDYS.
MER'ron HOUSE, CAMBRIDGE.
May, 1910.
