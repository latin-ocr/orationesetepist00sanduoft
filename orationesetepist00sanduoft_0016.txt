Preface

as in the *case os distinguished foreigners, or experts in music. The first that
Ι so presented was Mr (now Sir) Hubert Parry‚ in 1883. Finally, from June
1904, I adopted it in all cases. The use of a universal language like Latin
is specially appropriate on academie occasions of international interest, and
I have reason to know that the adoption of the reformed pronunciation has
been welcomed on a series of such occasions, ending with the Darwin Com-
memoration of last June. That pronunciation has now become sufficiently
familiar to senior Members of the Senate, as well as to junior members of the
University.

The presence of a large audience in the galleries, as well as on the floor of
the Senate House, on occasions of special interest, serves as a reminder to
any one whose duty it is to speak in Latin that, above all things, he must never
be prolix, An English audience is usually generous enough to listen to anyone
who obeys the last of Luther’s three rules, which 1 once heard quoted by
Professor William Selwyn at the opening of the new buildings of the Union
Society in 1866 :—stelze fest anfi· tltue den Mund auf,· heire bald auf,· ‘stand
up firmly; open your mouth bold1y; leave off timely’. It is the endeavour
to avoid the risk of becoming dull that is the justification for certain lighter
touches‚ which are less appropriate in a printed page, but may perhaps be
charitably forgiven on the general principle applied by Cicero to some of his own
pleasantries in the Pro Murcum—aliquid coronae datum¹. A severer style
is naturally reserved for the Letters sent to University Benefactors, and to other
Universities or Learned Societies. Almost all of these were sealed by Grace os
the Senate. Two (Nos. 532 and 540) were written at the request of the Vice-
Chancellor at a time of the year when a Congregation sor approving them was
not available. One of them (No. 541), the Letter of Condolence with the
University of Leyden on the death os Cobet, was unofficial, but, as it was signed
by all the resident representatives of Cambridge classical scholarship, it is here
printed as an epistola Cantabrzjgienszk. Another (No. 553), the Letter of thanks
addressed to the generous founders of the Hopkinson Memorial‚ was (for reasons
officially approved) written in English. Ἰ

In seeing this volume through the press, it was originally my intention
simply to add the references for the passages quoted or translated in the text,
and to leave all else to speak for itself. But, after the first twenty-seven pages
were already in type, Ι became conscious that, owing to lapse of time or other
causes, the point of many of the allusions might not be perfectly obvious.
Compositions so brief as these must necessarily be allusive. Thus, it is rarely
possible, or (if possible) appropriate, to quote in the Latin text the actual title
