been a gradual change in the Latin equivalent for ‘William ¹. The traditional
Gulielmus, retained in an early Letter sealed by the University1, was, in general
accordance with Mr E. A. Freeman’s opinion, given up for Wilelmus, and, at his
own direct suggestion, it was ultimately set aside in favour of Willelmus2. In
the revised text Ι have more frequently used the normal Ciceronian formula,
abhinc annos viginti, instead of the various alternatives found in later Latin.
A doubt once raised as to the correctness of my repeated use of non unus, in the
sense of plus quam unus, led to my occasionally substituting the latter, until
1 found that the former (although rare in Cicero) was in fact supported by at
least a dozen examples in the Institutio Oratoria of Quintilian.

In revising the many speeches in honour of members of Trinity College, 1 have
now adopted, more frequently than before, the name which has the advantage
of being the original title of that Collegez-Collegium Sanctae et Individuae
Trinitatis. This is the only title recognised in the Latin statutes and in the
body of the charter, and it is in strict accordance with ancient ecclesiastical
usage. The shorter title Sanctae Trinitatis may be seen in the margin of the
head of the charter, and is implied in Bentley’s inscription on Roger Cotes in
the ante-chapel, which has the single S. for Sanctae. The double letter, S.S. or
SS„ for Sanctissimae, is found in the same ante-chapel in the later inscriptions
in honour of Porson, Dobree, Burn and Cobb, and on the pedestals of the
statues of Bacon and Tennyson ⁸. The superlative variety of the abbreviated
title is, presumably, a reverential form of words, derived from popular usage,
without possessing quite the same authority as the title given to the College
in its charter, In revising my proofs I have only once introduced Sanctissimae
(No. 154), while I have often used Sanctae, and have entirely discarded the
unauthorised Sacrosanctae.

On the ground that adjectives ending in —ensis ought only to be formed
from names of places, and never from names of persons, I have always preferred
Universitas Yaleana to Yalensis (the epithet still in use at New Haven), and
Collegium Owensianum to Owense (certainly once used in Manchester). Yalensis
cannot be correctly applied to the University endowed by Elihu Yale, but only
to a University established at a place bearing that name; and Owense would
obviously be open to a similar objection. The case of Balliol College is
peculiar. The name of the founder, John de Baliol, happens to end with the
name of a place. Nevertheless‚ as the College is not at any place called Baliol,
