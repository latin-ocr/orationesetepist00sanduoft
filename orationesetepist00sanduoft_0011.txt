PREFACE

HE present volume contains a complete collection of the Latin Speeches

and Letters‚ which I have had the privilege of writing during the last
thirty-three academical years, as Public Orator in the University of Cambridge.
Many of them have been preserved in manuscript alone, or have been only
privately printed. A few have appeared z'n extenso in lee Times; others
solely in the Cambridge Chronicle, or (in the case of many of the speeches
on Bishops or Deans) solely in The Guardian. Those relating to men of
science have been regularly printed in Nature. In the Cambridge University
Reperter, where a majority of them have appeared, the series has been complete
and uninterrupted since June 1893, but there are many gaps in the record
of the seventeen years preceding that date.

The publication of these compositions in a collected form has been suggested
to me from time to time in the most diverse quarters. Thus, a sew years
ago, a distinguished man of letterS, a member of the University of Oxford,
urged that such a work would be ‘a record of contemporary honours ’, and
‘an honourable memorial of the public spirit of Cambridge'.

The publication of the work at this particular date has been mainly
prompted by the writer's completion of thirty-three years of service in the
autumn of 1909. In the spring of that year a precedent was opportunely
set by my friend, Dr Merry, the Public Orator of the sister University, who
then published the admirable Creweian and other Orations, which he had
delivered in the Sheldonian Theatre and elsewhere during his distinguished
tenure of an Office which he has adorned for thirty years, and which he has
recently resigned amid universal regret. Late in the autumn, the dark-blue
volume published by the Clarendon Press was followed by one in the green
binding characteristic of Trinity College, Dublin, containing a hundred and
sorty-one brief and brilliant speeches delivered in the course of twenty years
by three successive Orators. It also included the felicitous and comprehensive
panegyric pronounced on the memorable occasion of the Tercentenary by one
of those three, the editor of the volume, my friend, Professor Tyrrell. In
his preface, he expresses the hope that the book will be acceptable not only
to the Honorary Graduates of Dublin, ⁸ but also to others who take an interest
in a form of composition which is quite sui generis, and which has perhaps,
in some instances, an historic as well as literary interest’.
