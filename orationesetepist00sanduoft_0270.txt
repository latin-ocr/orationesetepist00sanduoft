Mrs John Hopkz‘nson. Dr T aylor,

From the Senate of the Unz'versity of Cambridge
to Mrs John Hopkinson, Mr Bertram Hoffz‘nson, and Mz‘ss Ellen Hopkinson.

(553) THE Senate of the University of Cambridge has recently been informed of an
offer on the part of MRs JoHN HOPK1NsoN and her son BERTRAM and her daughter
ELLEN to apply the sum of five thousand pounds to the building of a Memorial of her
late husband and of her son JoHN GUSTAVE in connexion with the Cambridge School of
Engineering. This most generous offer having been gratefully accepted by the Senate, it
is now the duty of the University to convey to the donors the most cordial thanks for
their munificent benefaction. No gift could be more noble in itself‚ none more pathetic
in its origin, none more appropriate in its purpose.

A sense of gratitude for the gift is blended with a feeling of sympathy and sorrow for
the sudden and untimely death of those in whose memory it is offered. By the death of
JoHN HOPKINSON in the fulness of his bodily and intellectual powers the University has
lost one of her most distinguished sons, who, after winning the highest honours in the
study of Mathematics, attained eminence as an Engineer by the integrity of his character
and the soundness of bis judgment‚ by the practical sagacity which he felicitously com-
bined with profound knowledge and genius, and by the brilliancy and originality of the
work which he accomplished in the cause of Science. The University also laments the
death of one in the prime of youth who had looked forward to entering the School of
Engineering in the present Term with the hope of following in his father’s footsteps.

The memory of the father and the son will be enshrined in the most fitting of
Memorials, and will be permanently associated with the expansion of the scientific study
of Engineering in Cambridge 3 while the names of the benefactors to whose generosity the
Memorial is due will ever be retained in the grateful remembrance of the University.

Sealed with the Common Seal os the Unz'versz’ty
this tenth day of November, A.D. MDCCCXCVIIIl.

¹ There have been two cases in which ladies have received Latin Letters of thanks from the

University‚ (1) that of Miss Anne Sheepshanks (1858), and (2) that of Mrs Elizabeth Ellison (1863). In
view, however, of all the circumstances connected with the above benefaction, it was proposed by the
Orator, with the approval of the Vice-Chancellor (Dr Hill, Master of Downing)‚ and the other Members of
the Council of the Senate, that on this occasion the gratitude of the University should be expressed
in English. A printed copy of the Letter was afterwards placed by Professor Ewing in the Lecture-room

of the Memorial Building.
