Preface

1 prefer Collegium Balliolanum to Balliolense‚ while 1 am well aware that the
official title is Collegium de Balliolo. The University of Aberdeen I have now
uniformly described as Universitas Aberdonensis. This was the form officially
used by the University on the occasion of its Quatercentenary. It seems to
imply that the place was once known as Aberdonum. The Latin name of the
place is now Aberdonia, and it is from this that the students, in issuing their
invitations on the same occasion, correctly formed the less frequent epithet,
Aberdoniensis, which I once preferred. ¹

The results of the minute researches of Zielinski on the rhythm of the
clausulae in Cicero’s Speeches, published in 1904¹‚ have added, I will not say
a new terror to the task of writing Latin prose, but a series of statistical facts
for respectsul consideration. Zielinski's general rule may be briefly stated by
saying that, in Cicero’s Speeches, the sentence most frequently closes with a
cretic base followed by a trochaic cadence of two or more syllables that is,
with -υ - (followed by -υ, or -υ -, or - υ - υ, or ----- ete.). Hence the
following are among the best typical forms: morte vicerunt; cessit audaciae;
audeat judimre3 and spiritum pertimescerem, but there are many variations‚
which cannot here be noticed. A certain familiarity with Cicero’s teaching
in the Orator had already led me to make frequent use of the cadence of the
double trochee, as in comprobavit3 and on several occasions I found reason
to inser that, on this point, modern ears were as susceptible as those of the
ancient Romans2. The first set of speeches deliberately written in accordance
with the new rules was that of 14 June 1905. Since then I have, necessarily,
been more or less conscious of the existence of those rules, and have
sometimes half-unconsciously kept them, without having always had sufficient
time to follow them minutely.

During the years covered by the speeches in this volume, the question
of Latin pronunciation has been from time to time before the public. While
1 have always sympathised with the cause of reform, my earlier practice was to
acquiesce in a somewhat precise variety of the ordinary English pronunciation.
One who is officially ‘ the voice of the Senate ' ought (I felt) to speak in a form
of Latin understood by the Senate3 and Ι have never forgotten the law laid down
by Cicero :—semper oratorum eloquentiae moderatrix fuit auditorum prudentia ⁸.
1 afterwards adopted the reformed pronunciation in those cases in which I had
reason to believe that it would be more agreeable to the recipient of the degree,
